                <h4>Strength training</h4>
                <p>Strength training or resistance training involves the performance of physical exercises that are designed to improve 
                    strength and endurance. It is often associated with the lifting of weights.
                    It can also incorporate a variety of training techniques such as bodyweight exercises, isometrics, and plyometrics.

                <br>
                <h4>Cardio</h4>
                <p>Cardio is short for cardiovascular and refers to workouts and exercises that challenge and develop your heart, lungs, 
                    and circulatory system. Cardiovascular workouts are very good for your health, and most people tend to do them to 
                    burn fat and lose weight. So, if you want to get leaner and fitter, cardio is the workout for you. There are a 
                    couple of different cardio approaches to consider.
                    <br><br><button class="button" id="Cardio" value="Cardio">Choose workout.</button>

            <div class = "col2">
                <br>
                <h4>LISS</h4>
                <p>Low-Intensity Steady State cardio, this type of workout is long, slow, and relatively easy.
                    Examples include brisk walking and jogging, distance cycling, swimming, and doing non-stop cardio on a machine, 
                    such as an elliptical, exercise bike, treadmill, or rower.

                <br>
                <h4>HIIT</h4>
                <p>High-Intensity Interval Training, HIIT involves short periods of intense cardio alternated with low-intensity rests.
                    For example, cycle as fast as you can for 30 seconds, pedal slowly for 90 seconds, and repeat ten times.
                    HIIT workouts are shorter but more demanding than LISS workouts.

                <h4>Group exercise classes</h4>
                <p>If you like to work with other people, group exercise classes will probably appeal to you.
                    There are many different options, including step aerobics, spinning, circuits, and dance-based classes like Zumba.

            <div class = "col2">
                <br>
                <h4>Flexibility/mobility</h4>
                <p>Becoming more flexible and mobile can have a big impact on how you look and feel, which is the very definition of a transformation.
                    Poor posture, stiff joints, and tight muscles can affect how you move, sit, and stand – and not for the better!
                    Working on your flexibility and mobility means better posture, and better posture makes you instantly look younger and slimmer.
                    Think about an older person you know; they are probably a little hunched and have an uncertain gait.
                    Walking tall and moving smoothly will make you look and feel so much younger.
                    Good workouts for better flexibility and mobility include:
                    Stretching, Yoga, Pilates, Martial arts, Gymnastics, Calisthenics

            <div class = "col2">
                <br>
                <h4>Balance training</h4>
                <p>Balance is your ability to keep your center of mass over your base of support.
                    In other words, it's the skill of not falling over!
                    Balance is an often-overlooked aspect of fitness, but as you get older, it becomes more and more important.
                    Balance tends to degrade with age and, combined with a loss of strength and mobility, leads to an increased risk of suffering falls.
                    While better balance won’t have a huge impact on how you look, it could enhance your workout performance, so you get better results.
                    Also, improving and preserving your balance will help maintain your quality of life as you age.

            </div>
            <div class = "col2">
                <br>
                <h4>Stability training</h4>
                <p>Stability and balance are often confused, but they’re actually very different.
                    Balance is a neurological skill.
                    For example, you could balance on one leg and stop yourself from falling over by shifting your weight every time you wobble.
                    In contrast, stability is your ability to use your muscles to hold your limbs in a certain position.
                    So, while standing on one leg to develop your balance, your muscles contract to steady your supporting knee and hip, eliminating unwanted movement.
